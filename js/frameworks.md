Vue is pretty easy to learn. Companies switch to Vue because its seems to be much easier for junior developers. Here you can read about somebody describing his team’s move from Angular to Vue. According to another user, the React app at his company was so complex that a new developer couldn’t keep up with the code. With Vue, the gap between junior and senior developers shrinks, and they can collaborate more easily and with fewer bugs, problems and time to develop.
