# Project Setup Automation
It is so important to automate all the setups of a project, including install, and build and run.
This is especially important to development because
* we might do that again and again
* we might forget the details, and after some time (e.g. 1 month), we can still easily catch up with the development.

# Code quality control

* findbugs, code style check, errcheck (golang)
