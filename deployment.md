## Quick start
https://github.com/pinterest/teletraan/wiki/Quickstart-guide
* Manual Option
  * wget is faster
  * Capacity Config - use "test-host-1" as the hostname because this is the content in /teletraan-demo/deploy-sentinel/host_info
  * Might need to run "deploy-agent" twice to make the deployment start to deploy
