## Multi-line


According to json specification (http://json.org/), 
```
A string is a sequence of zero or more Unicode characters, wrapped in double quotes, using backslash escapes.

i.e.

"< any Unicode character except " or \ or control character>"
```

  JSON is an extremely rigid schema. It's great, but it has a couple of shortcomings, the largest of which is the inability to store multi-line strings.
