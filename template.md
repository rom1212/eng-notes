* don't make it too complicated, because it is not easy to validate
* Make it easy to see the deployments.
* super group might use template.
* How to make it easy to validate a template (if it a python script, then we can write test on it). However, general template is not easy to validate.
  * write a tool to validate a template - test it, e.g. a cli/lib/UI tool to create deployments from those template.
    A lib tool is better.
* groups of group
  * each group is a template
  * super group is just a group of group: this will make make it simple, and re-usable.
